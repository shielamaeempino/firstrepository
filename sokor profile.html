<h2> Interesting Facts</h2>
<ol>
<li> <b>BORN AT 1 </b></li>
<p> &#x2022; Unlike other countries around the world, in Korea, when a baby is born, they are classed as being 1 years old. All birthdays are celebrated on the 1st January each year and every person becomes a year older.</p>

<li> <b>BLOOD MATTERS</b></li>
 <p> &#x2022; In Korea, it is believed that your blood type is intrinsically linked to the type of person you are. It is therefore very common for the subject to come up in conversation very early on in a meeting with natives.</p>

<li> <b> FACIAL HAIR</b></li>
<p> &#x2022; The popularity of facial hair in western countries has increased over recent decades. In Korea however, facial hair is deemed as a sign that the person is dirty, poor and uncaring about their appearance. This isn’t necessarily the case with visitors or tourists, but very much so amongst the local population.</p>

<li> <b> 3,400 ISLAND</b></li>
<p> &#x2022; Korea is actually made up of 3,400 separate islands! While this is an impressive figure, some of these islands are incredibly small. In fact, only 473 of these islands are actually inhabited.</p>


<li> <b> GETTING ONLINE</b></li>
<p> &#x2022; Korea has one of the fastest average internet speeds in the world! On top of this, it also has the fastest and most accessible free Wi-Fi networks on the planet! 93% of the population use the internet, and with free access on transportation, city centres and other public areas, its not a surprise. </p>

<li><b> FAMILY NAMES </b></li> 
<p> &#x2022; In most countries the variety of surnames is incredible. While there are more popular ones (Smith, Jones etc), in Korea you will only come across a handful of surnames regularly with Kim being the most popular. Nearly 20% of the population have the surname Kim which equates to nearly 10 million people! </p>

<li><b> WRITTEN IN RED</b></li>
<p> &#x2022; When visiting Korea, be sure not to use a red pen, especially when signing documents. It is believed that the use of red ink is a signal of death! The symbolism of red ink is linked to blood and is a bad omen for those signing or being handed the document in question</p>

<li><b>SIR, MISS, DOCTOR, OFFICER</b></li>
<p> &#x2022; When speaking to an elder in Korea, it is considered standard practice to refer to them by their title rather than first name. This could be a case of using their professional title e.g. Doctor or Professor, or as simply as Mr or Miss.

It is also common to refer to parents of children in relation to their child’s name such as John’s Mum. </p>
